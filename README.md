# Noise Pollution from Construction Sites on UT Austin Campus
Data is sourced from four points to find the effect of construction site noise pollution on UT Austin students. The first data is collected from the City of Austin data portal regarding construction sites and sound ordinance permits. The data is cleaned by filtering out rows where their status are empty, VOID, Appeal, Filed, or Denied. Additionally rows whoâ€™s decibel levels are empty or include 1 are filtered out.
The second data source used in this research is a student-conducted survey designed to collect perceptions of construction-related noise pollution and its effects on wellbeing at UT Austin. The survey included questions addressing demographic information, academic workload, time spent outdoors on campus, and personal experiences with noise disturbances. Specific questions targeted the physical and emotional impacts of construction noise, such as stress, concentration issues, and sleep disruption. Participants were also asked to identify common campus locations they frequent and estimate the decibel levels they find uncomfortable. Before analysis, we filtered the permit data to exclude those that were expired, inactive, or pending revisions, ensuring alignment with the active periods that may have influenced respondents' experiences. A full list of the survey questions can be found in the appendix. For both datasets from the city of Austin, we removed columns that did not pertain to exploring the effects of noise pollution on UT Austin campuses. 
The third source comes from decibel and hertz recordings near the construction sites, capturing both the frequency and pitch of sounds, as well as their loudness. I walked around campus near construction sites and recording the decibel level on my phone. Lastly, I posted posters and tabling around the GDC, EER, and near Jester to gather sentiment regarding the noise pollution from construction sites. I asked questions like what their academic standing was, how many credit hours they took, how much the noises affected them, how it affected them, the location they most frequent, how loud they can hear and the average amount of them they are outside around UT Austin campus.
The type of computation will mainly be in R for EDA/help explore and analyze the composition of the data I collected. Before that, I will first be using Python to clean and organize the data and then extracting the cleaned dataset into R to analyze. I want to utilize R packages and other methods to calculate the sentiments from the responses regarding how the noise pollution from the construction site affect the individual. Additionally, I will analyze the relationship of how affected they are by the noise pollution versus the noise decibel of the construction sites near where they are most often.
